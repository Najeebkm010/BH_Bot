# Security Scanner Discord Bot

A Discord bot that provides security scanning capabilities through simple commands. The bot integrates multiple security tools including `subfinder`, `nmap`, `nf` (Nuclear Fuzzer), `paramspider`, and `kxss` to automate basic security reconnaissance directly from Discord.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Scan for subdomains using `subfinder`
- **Port Scanning**: Perform port scans using `nmap`
- **NF Scanning**: Run Nuclear Fuzzer (nf) scans for security testing
- **XSS Detection**: Discover reflected XSS using `paramspider` + `kxss`
- **IP Lookup**: Resolve domain to IP address using built-in Python libraries
- **Smart Output**: Results sent directly in Discord if small, or uploaded as a file if large
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary result files are removed after sending
- **Basic Error Filtering**: Logs only real errors, ignores tool info/debug output

```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install discord.py
```

3. Install system dependencies:
```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu systems
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nmap
golang git

# Install subfinder
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest

# Install paramspider
git clone https://github.com/devanshbatham/paramspider
cd paramspider && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Install kxss
go install github.com/tomnomnom/kxss@latest

# Install nf (Nuclear Fuzzer)
git clone https://github.com/devanshbatham/Nuclear
cd Nuclear && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Install nf (follow the tool's specific installation instructions)
```

4. Set Execution Permissions
chmod +x subfinder_scan.sh nmap_scan.sh nf_scan.sh

5. Configure Bot
Replace 'Your Discord Token' in bot.py with your actual Discord Bot Token

## Usage

Once the bot is running, use the following commands in your Discord server:

```
| Command          | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `!subs <domain>` | Enumerate subdomains                        |
| `!port <domain>` | Perform port scanning                       |
| `!nf <domain>`   | Run Nuclear Fuzzer scan                     |
| `!xss <domain>`  | Detect reflected XSS via paramspider + kxss |
| `!ip <domain>`   | Resolve domain to IP address                |
```

Example usage:

```
!subs example.com
!port example.com
!nf example.com
!xss testphp.vulnweb.com
!ip google.com
```

## Security Considerations

- Cleanup: All temporary files are deleted after execution
- Permissions: Only scan domains you are authorized to test
- Token Safety: Never share your Discord token publicly
- Rate Limiting: Consider implementing user access control

## Error Handling

The bot includes error handling for:
- Tool execution failures
- Missing output files
- Message size limits (Discord max 2000 characters)
- Logs only serious errors, filters out harmless info/debug logs
